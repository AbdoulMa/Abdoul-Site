    "contents": "\nI started learning R a couple months ago, because I spend a lot time on Twitter and was always amazed by all the great graphics made with this statistical programming language. First of all, I followed essentially some great sport Data Analysts like Owen Phillips who post great charts about NBA Players & Community Stats.\n\n\nSome Owenâ€™s Tweets\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1377974728233734148\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1405137683467456513\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\nâ€“ Owen Pihllips((owenlhjphillips?))\n\n\nAnd as things progress, I started following more and more people from R Community and particularly those who contribute to the Tidytuesday weekly Data Visualization Challenge.\nAs, my passion keeps growing, I started learning R typically with short tutorial like those amazing ones from CÃ©dric Scherer or Thomas Mock but also with some bookdown particularly the bible for the beginners and the aspiring data scientists R for Data Science (Wickham and Grolemund 2017).\nOn May 5, 2020, I made my first contribution for the Tidytuesday Challenge. I wasnâ€™t expecting a lot of likes but what happened was just magical.\n\nThe dataset was about Water Acces Points and come from WPDX. My analysis of the data wasnâ€™t the adequate one and my lines plot was even less, but my intention was principally to give birth to a presentable plot with my beginner knowledge.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1389976276765716488\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nâ€“ Abdoul Madjid((issa_madjid?))\n\n I received a ton of compliments and advices for that meme lines plot, what acted like a boost for my little ego ðŸ˜…. So from that initial post, I have decided, despite my professional life schedule:\nto be a weekly contributor to the TidyTuesday Challenge\nto try to progress from the feedback I received from the Community\nand to build a blog with {distill} which is used to build scientific and technical writing and native blog with R Markdown\n\nSo Here, We go.\n\nAcknowledgement\nA big thank you to all the amazing contributors to the R community.\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. 2017.
