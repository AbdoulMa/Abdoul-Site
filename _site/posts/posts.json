Fist of all, I followed essentially some great sport Data Analysts like Owen Phillips who post great charts about NBA Players & Community Stats.\n\n\nHa! This is an excerpt from our abstract: Our preliminary analysis found that only 2.4% of the images contained a text description entered by the tweet author compared to 84% which were described by default as ‚ÄúImage‚Äù üò¨Full abstract available at https://t.co/nqn9VFgWkK\n\n‚Äî Silvia Canel√≥n (@spcanelon) March 26, 2021\n\nAnd as things progress, I started following people from R Community and particulary those who contribute to the Tidytuesday weeekly Data Vizualisation Challenge.\nAs, my passion keep growing, I started learning R typpically with short tutorial like the Amazing one C√©dric Scherer but also with some bookdown particulary the bible for the beginners and the aspiring data scientists R for Data Science by Hadley Wicham and Garett Grolemund.\nOn May 5th, I make my first submission to the Tidytuesday Challenge. I didn‚Äôt wait for a lot likes but what happened was just magical.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1389976276765716488\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\n \n\nI received a ton of compliments and advices for a simple lines plot.\n\n\n\n",
