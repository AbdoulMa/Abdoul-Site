    "contents": "\nI started learning R a couple months ago, because I spend a lot time on Twitter and was always amazed by all the great graphics made with this statistical programming langage. Fist of all, I followed essentially some great sport Data Analysts like Owen Phillips who post great charts about NBA Players & Community Stats.\n\n\nSome Owen’s Tweets\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1377974728233734148\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1405137683467456513\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\n– Owen Pihllips(@owenlhjphillips)\n\n\nAnd as things progress, I started following more and more people from R Community and particulary those who contribute to the Tidytuesday weeekly Data Vizualisation Challenge.\nAs, my passion keep growing, I started learning R typpically with short tutorial like thoses amazing ones from Cédric Scherer or Thomas Mock but also with some bookdown particulary the bible for the beginners and the aspiring data scientists R for Data Science by Hadley Wicham and Garett Grolemund.\nOn May 5th, I make my first submission to the Tidytuesday Challenge. I didn’t wait for a lot likes but what happened was just magical.\n\nThe dataset was about Water Acces Points and come from WPDX. My analysis of the data wasn’t the adequate one and my lines plot was even less but my intention was principally to give birth to a presentable plot with my beginner knowledge.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"twid\":\"1389976276765716488\",\"pars\":{\"align\":\"center\"}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n– Abdoul Madjid(@issa_madjid)\n\n I received a ton of compliments and advices for a simple lines plot, what acted like a boost for my little ego. So from an initial post, I have decided despite my professional life schedule :\nto be a weekly contributor to the TidyTuesday Challenge\nto try to progress from the feedbacks I received from the Community\nand to build a blog with {distill} which is used to build scientific and technical writing and native blog with R Markdown\n\n\n\n",
