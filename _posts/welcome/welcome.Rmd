I  started learning `R` a couple months ago, because I spend a lot time on Twitter and was always amazed by  all the great graphics  made with this statistical programming langage. 
Fist of all, I followed essentially some great sport Data Analysts like [Owen Phillips](https://twitter.com/owenlhjphillips) who post great charts about NBA Players & Community Stats.

And as things progress, I started following people from R Community and particulary those who contribute to the `Tidytuesday` weeekly Data Vizualisation Challenge. 

As, my passion keep growing, I started learning R typpically with short tutorial like the Amazing one [CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/?s=09) but also with some `bookdown` particulary the bible  for the beginners and the aspiring data scientists [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) by **Hadley Wicham** and **Garett Grolemund**.


On May 5th, I make my first submission to the `Tidytuesday` Challenge. I didn't wait for a lot likes but what happened was just magical. 

<blockquote>
The dataset was about Water Acces Points and come from [WPDX](https://www.waterpointdata.org/). 
My analysis of the data wasn't the adequate one and my lines plot was even less but  my intention was principally 
to give birth to a presentable plot with my beginner knowledge.

I received a ton of compliments  and advices for a  simple lines plot.
